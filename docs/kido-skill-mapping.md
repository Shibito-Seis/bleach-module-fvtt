# Kidō & Skills — Recommended PF2E Mapping

## Can we replace skills like “Arcana” with “Kidō”?

Not cleanly.

- PF2E’s skill list is **system-defined**.
- A module can re-skin names in **text** (item descriptions, journals) and later in a **custom sheet**, but replacing/adding core skills in a stable way generally requires forking the PF2E system.

So for v0.1 we keep PF2E skills mechanically intact, and we **map** them to Bleach terms.

## Mapping we will use (default)

- **Arcana → Hadō** (offensive Kidō)
- **Occultism → Bakudō** (binding/sealing Kidō)
- **Religion → Kaidō / Barriers** (healing & purification; also fits spiritual rites)

## Optional: “Kidō Lore”

If you want a single roll representing overall Kidō scholarship without changing core skills:

- Add **Lore: Kidō** (a Lore skill)
- Use it for: identifying incantations, historical forms, styles, schools

Mechanically this is easy and fully compatible with PF2E.

## UI naming later (custom sheet)

When we build the Bleach sheet, we can *display* these labels as Hadō/Bakudō/Kaidō while still rolling Arcana/Occultism/Religion under the hood.
